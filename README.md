# NLP Sarcasm Detection using BERT  
**Understanding Sarcasm in Political Discourse using NLP and Transformer-based Models**  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains the implementation of a **BERT-based sarcasm detection model** for analyzing political discourse on the **EkÅŸi SÃ¶zlÃ¼k** platform. The project explores how sarcasm is used as a critique tool in online political discussions, particularly focusing on **Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan** and **Kemal KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄŸlu**.

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
âœ… **BERT-based Sarcasm Detection:** Fine-tuning **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)** to identify sarcastic comments.  
âœ… **Political Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing sarcasm trends in online discussions related to TÃ¼rkiyeâ€™s political landscape.  
âœ… **Data Preprocessing & Annotation:** Cleaning, normalizing, and labeling data for sarcasm classification.  
âœ… **Model Training & Performance Evaluation:** Evaluating BERTâ€™s accuracy and effectiveness compared to other NLP models.
